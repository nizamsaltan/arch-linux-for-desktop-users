# 3. Understaning Window Systems in Unix like Systems
After installing base linux system, we need some base packages to use our computer traditionaly. For example we need web browser to surf on the web or an app launcher to launch apps in our system, like web browser. There is have so much to talk about but to understand how computers interact with hardware, let's take a look at  **Xorg**

## Xorg
The X.Org project provides an open source implementation of the X Window System. The development work is being done in conjunction with the [freedesktop.org](http://freedesktop.org) community. The [X.Org Foundation](https://x.org/wiki/XorgFoundation/) is the educational non-profit corporation whose [Board](https://x.org/wiki/BoardOfDirectors/) serves this effort, and whose [Members](https://x.org/wiki/Membership/) lead this work.

But what is X Window System? you might ask. Here is answer.

The **X Window System** (**X11**, or simply **X**) is a [windowing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system "Windowing system") for [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap "Bitmap") displays, common on [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") operating systems.

X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard. X does not mandate the user interface – this is handled by individual programs. As such, the visual styling of X-based environments varies greatly; different programs may present radically different interfaces.

In basic terms, X Window System is gets input from hardware, gives information to current running apps and then draws output on the screen. We need to run X before running our GUI apps. 

There is also another option for X11 called Wayland. Wayland is a replacement for the X11 window system protocol and architecture with the aim to be easier to develop, extend, and maintain. But beacuse of newness of Wayland, we don't use it in this guide, rather than more mature X11.

We can start X by simply typing `startx` command followed by path to the window manager. For example `startx /usr/bin/i3`. So without making things more complicated for X, let's look at **Window Managers**

## Window Managers
In ist core, window managers handle the placement and appereance of windows on the screen. It can be part of a Desktop Environments or be used as standalone. There is have 3 diffrent types of window managers;

-   [Stacking/Floating](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager#Stacking_window_managers) window managers is the traditional WMs used in commercial operating systems like Windows and macOS. In these WMs windows can be stacked on top of each other. KWin, Sawfish or Openbox is popular options for stacking WMs. 
-   [Tiling](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager#Tiling_window_managers) window managers "tile" the windows so that none are overlapping. They usually make very extensive use of key-bindings and have less (or no) reliance on the mouse. Tiling window managers may be manual, offer predefined layouts, or both. i3, Qtile or Xmonad is popular options for tiling WMs. 
-   [Dynamic](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager#Dynamic_window_managers) window managers can switch between floating and tiling window layout.
