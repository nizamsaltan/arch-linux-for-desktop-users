# 4. Base System Requirements
In order to interact with our computer, we need some basic tools. These are include *Window Manager*, *App launcher* etc. But in this section, don't install tools, this is just introduction to them. You can select them in next part.

Yes you can live without them but I call them *Base System Requirements* because these tool going to make everyones life easier. So let's start by installing window manager.

## Window Manager
This is realy depens on personal preferences. In previus chapter, we discussed diffrent types of window managers and some examples for them.

### i3 Gaps 
To make clear, the most (or only) diffrence between *i3* and *i3 gaps* is as it named i3 gaps have gap/space betwen windows. This help *[r/unixporn](reddit.com/r/unixporn/)* comunity to rice better and for us better visual.
> i3 is a [tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager), completely written from scratch. The target platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license. i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.

but before running X to runing *gui apps* let's install some more tools.

## Terminal Emulators
 First, we need an terminal emulator to run run command in gui. We have so many options for chosing terminal emulator. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators) is list of all terminal emulators if you are nerd, if not here is some examples and screenshots of them. 
 
 ### Konsole
 Konsole is KDE's offical terminal emulator. Features 
 * Multiple tabs support
* Multiple profiles support
* Silence and Activity monitoring
* Bookmark support
* Searching
* Saving output
* Multiple splits in any tab

### Alacritty
Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but allows for extensive configuration. By integrating with other applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to provide a flexible set of features with high performance. The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Gnome Terminal
**GNOME Terminal** is a terminal emulator for the GNOME written by [Havoc Pennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havoc_Pennington "Havoc Pennington") and others. Terminal emulators allow users to access a UNIX shell while remaining on their graphical desktop.

###  Xfce4 Terminal

Xfce Terminal is a lightweight and easy to use terminal emulator application with many advanced features including drop down, tabs, unlimited scrolling, full colors, fonts, transparent backgrounds, and more.

## Application Launcher
Most popular application launchers are *[DMenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)* and *[Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)*. dmenu is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/). It manages large numbers of user-defined menu items efficiently. On the other hand Rofi, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of options where one or more can be selected. This can either be running an application, selecting a window, or options provided by an external script.

## File manager functionality
From wiki.archlinux.org

>**Note:** When installed, the software packages listed below will automatically be sourced by all installed - and capable - file managers, and within all desktop environments and/or window managers.

A file manager alone will not provide the features and functionality that users of full desktop environments such as [Xfce](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce "Xfce") or [KDE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE "KDE") will be accustomed to. This is because additional software packages will be required to enable a given file manager to:

-   Display and access other partitions
-   Display, mount, and access removable media (e.g. USB sticks, optical discs, and digital cameras)
-   Enable networking / shared networks with other installed operating systems
-   Enable thumbnailing
-   Archive and extract compressed files
-   Automatically mount removable media

When a file manager has been installed as part of a full desktop environment, most of these packages will usually have been installed automatically. Consequently, where a file manager has been installed for a standalone window manager then - as is the case with the window manager itself - only a basic foundation will be provided. The user must then determine the nature and extent of the features and functionality to be added.

## File Viewer
After adding file manager functionality, we can chose right tool to view it. File viewer can be both command line based or gui based, so it will be advantage to have both of them. Some of the options for command line file viewers are [**lf**](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) or [**ranger**](https://ranger.github.io/). For gui, we have much of options. Examples can be [**dolphin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_%28file_manager%29) for kde, [**natuilus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Files) (or gnome files) for gnome and [**thunar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunar) for xfce.

## Command Line Text Editors
 In some distro's there is have more than one command line text editor. And most popular one can be *vim* and *nano* Nano is relativly more beginner freindly because of listing some of the important shortcuts at bottom. On the other hand vim targets more advanced users. We can have multiple text editors in our system. Later of this book, we will configure these editors to get better experience. For example syntax highligting, line numbers etc.

## Downloading Base System Requiments
Finaly we understand big part of how DE works and we can start installing packages now!

#### Choosing Window Manager
My pick for Window Manager will be i3-gaps because of easy configuration, custumization and also being lightweight.
Download i3-gaps by typing:
	
	$ pacman -S i3-gaps

#### Choosing Terminal Emulator
I love xfce's terminal emulator because it's simple yet super custuziable. Download xfce4-terminal by
	
	$ pacman -S xfce4-terminal

#### Downloading Web Browser
After downloading terminal emulator, we can start installing a web browser. Some popular options would be chrome but because of open source and already including in arch's package manager I will use firefox for this. Download Firefox by typing;

    $ pacman -S firefox
 
 #### Downloaing Application Launcher
We need an application launcher to launch apps. Rofi is popular because of being super configurable and can be use in other panels to *(we will talk about them later on)* Download rofi by typing

    $ pacman -S rofi

 #### Downloading Command Line Text Editors
We can download nano and vim by typing;

    $ pacman -S nano vim

#### Downloading File Viewer
My pick for file manager is again will be xfce's file manager **thunar**. Download thunar by typing;

    $ pacman -S thunar
    
But in order to get more functonlaity from thunar we need to install some more packages too. For example if we want to extract packages directly inside file viewer than we need to install [**Thunar Archive Plugin**](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/archive). This plugin is only GUI for extisted packages so we can support it with [**File Roller**](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/FileRoller).  Download thunar archive plugin and file roller by typing;

    $ pacman -S thunar-archive-plugin file-roller

As I said thunar is super custimuziable so we can add more plugins to extend it's capablity. One of them can be thumb icons of images and videos. Xfce has a plugin for this called [**tumbler**](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/tumbler) we can download this plugin by typing;

    $ pacman -S tumbler

And finaly don't forget to install file system because if installed, Thunar will show the trash can, removable media, and remote filesystems. Install Gnome Virtual File System by typing

    $ pacman -S gvfs

### i3 Configuration
We need configure window manager to perfectly use tools we installed. But first let's run i3 and see what we did so far. Start X by typing

    $ startx /usr/bin/i3
