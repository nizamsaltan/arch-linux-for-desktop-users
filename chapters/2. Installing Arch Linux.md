# 2. Installing Arch Linux  
So many people would disagree with me about recommending Arch Linux for beginners. But learning the basics of Linux and with a proper guide, it’s relatively simple to use. Everyone’s reason for using Arch Linux is different, just like having various reasons for using Linux. I am using Arch Linux because I want to get as much freedom from Linux, and it also has a great package manager called ‘Pacman’.  
  
## Pre Instalation  
You can download the .iso file from *[https://archlinux.org/download/*](https://archlinux.org/download/*) and then flash the file to a USB drive using a flasher tool like _balena etcher._ I recommend first installing it into a virtual machine to understand and prevent any failures in the primary system. In this guide, I will use Virtual Box. But this book does not cover using virtual machines or flashing USBs. If you don’t know how to do them check the websites below.

## First Boot  
You can check offical guide via this link: *[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide*](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide*)  
  
After we first boot into Arch Linux, there is have some ugly terminal to help us install AL to our system. We have to option to install Arch Linux to our system. First is going to be manual if you want extreme configuration over your installation. Second is using an built in script to automate this process (of course it configurable because of it's arch).

## Using archinstall script 
To run built in instalation script type 

    archinstall
    
to terminal. After this you will see a window like this.
![archinstall script](https://github.com/nizamsaltan/arch_linux_for_desktop_users/blob/main/Screenshot_2023-02-20_11-47-36.png)
Let's go over each of them.

**Archinstall language**
This option is language set for archinstall script. Not system language!

**Keyboard layout**
Pick your keyboard layout 
> hint: you can use '/' key to search

**Locale language**
This option is language set for your system.

**Locale encoding**
Options for encoding texts. Keep it as UTF-8

**Drive(s)**
Choose wich drive to install linux in your system.

**Disk layout**
Partitioning your disk layout. If you installing Linux along side with other OSs than you would choose 'Select what to do with each individual drive' option to enter partitioning. 
If you want an clean install choose 'Wipe all selected drives and use a best-effort default partition layout' option. This option asks you to should create seprate partition for home folder. Let's discuss what is /home parition?

### /home Parition
'/home' is mount point of partition. Which means every files inside your home folder will be stored in diffrent disk parition. Some kinda backup parition. Because when we decided to change our distro or computer, we don't need to copy and save whoole data. because most of our important files is already inside '/home' partition.

**Encription password**
This option gives us opurtunity to encript our disk. This is not password of your system! Instead password of your disk. Meaning, password to read data from your disk. This option is useful if you want to encript your disk sepratly from your system. I personaly dont like to use seprate encription for my disk but if you keep important files in your system than this option is highly recommended among community.

**Bootloader**
In order to boot our Linux system, a Linux-capable boot loader must be set up. The boot loader is responsible for loading the kernel and initial ramdisk before initiating the boot process. Archinstall script gives us a default option depending on our system. Best to keep it as default in most of the time. Further read: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process

**Swap**
Swap space can be used for two purposes, to extend the virtual memory beyond the installed physical memory (RAM), and also for suspend-to-disk support. Highly recommended if you low on RAM resources.

**Hostname**
A hostname is a unique name created to identify a machine on a network. You can give whatever you want if you using your home network.

**Root password**
Password of root. Keep it something that you can remember. 

**User account**
Add users to your system.

**Profile**
// TODO:
_> xorg | graphics card driver

**Audio**
// TODO:
pipewire vs pulseaudio

**Kernels**
// TODO:

**Additional packages**
// TODO:
firefox xfce4-terminal

**Network configuration**
Configuration of your network. You have muliple options in hier. Because of we are going to use xorg profile, choose 'manual configuration' option. In hier choose 'Add interface' after this you are going to see available network interfaces. Choose wich interface you want to configure. Then you need to choose mode for your network interface. Best to keep it as 'DHCP' (auto detect) if you don't know your ip address.

**Timezone**
Choose your time zone
> hint: you can use '/' key to search

**Automatic time sync**
It's personal preference. But true option would be best for most of us.

**Optional repositories**
Arch Linux official repositories contain essential and popular software, readily accessible via pacman. They are maintained by package maintainers. 
Packages in the official repositories are constantly upgraded: when a package is upgraded, its old version is removed from the repository. There are no major Arch releases: each package is upgraded as new versions become available from upstream sources. Each repository is always coherent, i.e. the packages that it hosts always have reciprocally compatible versions.

My personal preferance: enable multilib

After all finaly click install to install Arch Linux in your system. After this you are going to see option for 'Enter chroot' click yes to enter because we need to install some packages.

## Manual Instalation

But first thing first, we need to tell system which keyboard layout we have.  
  
### Keyboard Layout  
If you don’t know your current layout code you can use `localectl list-keymaps` command to list all available layouts, then to select yours use `loadkeys *keymap*` . For example `loadkeys trq` for Turkish Q layout.  
  
### Internet Connection  
If you have ethernet cable connected to your computer (*some virtual machines can use host network. Check your network status with `ping archlinux.org`.*) than you are good to go. If not follow these steps to setup your internet connection over wifi. 

To connect internet, we will use arch's built in tool **iwctl** to get started, type `iwctl` command. You will realize the color of terminal is now changed. Now you can use `help` command to list all functions. To list current devices, type `device list`. If the device or its corresponding adapter is turned off, turn it on:

    $ device _device_ set-property Powered on
    $ adapter _adapter_ set-property Powered on

Then, to initiate a scan for networks (note that this command will not output anything):

    [iwd]# station _device_ scan

You can then list all available networks:

    [iwd]# station _device_ get-networks

Finally, to connect to a network:

    [iwd]# station _device_ connect _SSID_

    

If a passphrase is required, you will be prompted to enter it. After this you can exit tool by typing `exit`.
Alternatively, you can supply it as a command line argument:

    $ iwctl --passphrase _passphrase_ station _device_ connect _SSID_

Don't forget to check you connection with `ping archlinux.org` command :-)

### Partitioning  
Partitioning it self is huge part to consider because everyones needs and stuation is diffrent. If you are installing this alongside with other OS or if you have important files in your disk than I would highly recommend you to backup your data before partitioning.  
First you should check availiable disks in your system. Use `fdisk -l` command to list all disks and partitions on your system. To partition, I would recommend *cfdisk* rather than base *fdisk*. Go in *cfdisk* UI by typing `cfdisk *your_target_disk*`. Here is and example layout;  
  
| Mount point | Partition | [Partition type]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type) "wikipedia:Partition type") | Suggested size |  
|--|--|--|--|  
| /boot | /dev/_efi_system_partition_ | [EFI system partition]([https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition) "EFI system partition") *(fat32)* | Min 500 MiB. If multiple kernels will be installed, then no less than 1 GiB. |  
| /swap | /dev/_efi_system_partition_ | Linux Swap| Depends on current system disk. 2 GiB recommended. |
| / | /dev/_root_partition_ | Linux File System *(ext4)* | 40 GiB recommended. Min of 10 GiB |  
| /home | /dev/_home_partition_ | Linux File System *(ext4)* | Remaining space |  
  
> Boot(/_boot_) and root(/) patitions required to install system using *systemd* boot method  
  
We can mount partitions after succesfuly partitioning and formating target disk.  
  
### Mounting  
  
You can mount partitions using `mount --mkdir /dev/_root_partition_ /mnt` command. For example;  
  
- `mount --mkdir /dev/ /mnt/` -> for root partition  
- `mount --mkdir /dev/home /mnt/home` -> for home partition  
  
If you created a [swap]([https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap) "Swap") volume, enable it with: `swapon /dev/_swap_partition_`  
  
### Installation  

#### Select the mirrors  
  
Packages to be installed must be downloaded from [mirror servers]([https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mirrors](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mirrors) "Mirrors"), which are defined in `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`. On the live system, after connecting to the internet, [reflector]([https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector) "Reflector") updates the mirror list by choosing 20 most recently synchronized HTTPS mirrors and sorting them by download rate.  
  
The higher a mirror is placed in the list, the more priority it is given when downloading a package. You may want to inspect the file to see if it is satisfactory. If it is not, [edit]([https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Textedit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Textedit) "Textedit") the file accordingly, and move the geographically closest mirrors to the top of the list, although other criteria should be taken into account.  
  
This file will later be copied to the new system by _pacstrap_, so it is worth getting right.

###Fstab

Generate an [fstab](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fstab "Fstab") file (use `-U` or `-L` to define by [UUID](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/UUID "UUID") or labels, respectively):

#genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

Check the resulting `/mnt/etc/fstab` file, and [edit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Textedit "Textedit") it in case of errors.
