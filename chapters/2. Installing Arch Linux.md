# 2. Installing Arch Linux  
So many people would disagree with me about recommending Arch Linux for beginners. But learning the basics of Linux and with a proper guide, it’s relatively simple to use. Everyone’s reason for using Arch Linux is different, just like having various reasons for using Linux. I am using Arch Linux because I want to get as much freedom from Linux, and it also has a great package manager called ‘Pacman’.  
  
## Pre Instalation  
You can download the .iso file from *[https://archlinux.org/download/*](https://archlinux.org/download/*) and then flash the file to a USB drive using a flasher tool like _balena etcher._ I recommend first installing it into a virtual machine to understand and prevent any failures in the primary system. In this guide, I will use Virtual Box. But this book does not cover using virtual machines or flashing USBs. If you don’t know how to do them check the websites below.

## First Boot  
You can check offical guide via this link: *[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide*](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide*)  
  
After we first boot into Arch Linux, there is have some ugly terminal to help us install AL to our system. We have to option to install Arch Linux to our system. First is going to be manual if you want extreme configuration over your installation. Second is using an built in script to automate this process (of course it configurable because of it's arch).

## Using archinstall script 
To run built in instalation script type 

    archinstall
    
to terminal. After this you will see a window like this.

Let's go over each of them.

### Archinstall language
This option is language set for archinstall script. Not system language!

### Keyboard layout
Pick your keyboard layout 
> hint: you can use '/' key to search

### Locale language
This option is language set for your system.

### Locale encoding
Options for encoding texts. Keep it as UTF-8

### Drive(s)
Choose wich drive to install linux in your system.

### Disk layout
Partitioning your disk layout. If you installing Linux along side with other OSs than you would choose 'Select what to do with each individual drive' option to enter partitioning. 
If you want an clean install choose 'Wipe all selected drives and use a best-effort default partition layout' option. This option asks you to should create seprate partition for home folder. Let's discuss what is /home parition?

#### /home Parition
'/home' is mount point of partition. Which means every files inside your home folder will be stored in diffrent disk parition. Some kinda backup parition. Because when we decided to change our distro or computer, we don't need to copy and save whoole data. because most of our important files is already inside '/home' partition.

### Encription password
This option gives us opurtunity to encript our disk. This is not password of your system! Instead password of your disk. Meaning, password to read data from your disk. This option is useful if you want to encript your disk sepratly from your system. I personaly dont like to use seprate encription for my disk but if you keep important files in your system than this option is highly recommended among community.

### Bootloader
In order to boot our Linux system, a Linux-capable boot loader must be set up. The boot loader is responsible for loading the kernel and initial ramdisk before initiating the boot process. Archinstall script gives us a default option depending on our system. Best to keep it as default in most of the time. Further read: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process

### Swap
Swap space can be used for two purposes, to extend the virtual memory beyond the installed physical memory (RAM), and also for suspend-to-disk support. Highly recommended if you low on RAM resources.

### Hostname
A hostname is a unique name created to identify a machine on a network. You can give whatever you want if you using your home network.

### Root password
Password of root. Keep it something that you can remember. 

### User account
Add users to your system.
> Tip: It's recommended to add your main account to sudoers group.

### Profile
You can choose the profile of your instalation (ie. Desktop env. or Window Manager etc.). But since will will going to install our Window Manager by ourself, you can choose `xorg` option with your desired graphics card drivers.

### Audio
In Linux systems, we have 2 option for audio server. These are [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) and [PulseAudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio).  

Audio servers in it self is huge topic, and [Tony Tascioglu](https://www.youtube.com/@TonyTascioglu) has a greate video about this. You can check his video from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxEXMHcwtlI). But overall my personal preference is using PipeWire. 

### Kernels
// TODO:

### Additional packages
In this part, we can install some packages to use in our system. If you already choose a Window Manager or a Desktop Enviroment without an terminal emulator or web browser, it's recommended to do it in here. For example we can install Firefox and Xfce4 Terminal Emulator by typing

    firefox xfce4-terminal

### Network configuration
Configuration of your network. You have muliple options in hier. Because of we are going to use xorg profile, choose 'manual configuration' option. In hier choose 'Add interface' after this you are going to see available network interfaces. Choose wich interface you want to configure. Then you need to choose mode for your network interface. Best to keep it as 'DHCP' (auto detect) if you don't know your ip address.

### Timezone
Choose your time zone
> hint: you can use '/' key to search

### Automatic time sync
It's personal preference. But true option would be best for most of us.

### Optional repositories
Arch Linux official repositories contain essential and popular software, readily accessible via pacman. They are maintained by package maintainers. 
Packages in the official repositories are constantly upgraded: when a package is upgraded, its old version is removed from the repository. There are no major Arch releases: each package is upgraded as new versions become available from upstream sources. Each repository is always coherent, i.e. the packages that it hosts always have reciprocally compatible versions.

My personal preferance: enable multilib

##

After all finaly click install to install Arch Linux in your system. After this you are going to see option for 'Enter chroot' click yes to enter because we need to install some packages.
